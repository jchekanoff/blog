Joe is the CEO of [Chek Creative](https://chekcreative.com),
a Web Studio Without Limits. He leads a small, dedicated
web and app development team from his home in 
Worthington, Ohio.

His career in development began through the use of many 
early no-code tools of the web and has evolved to 
building completely custom WordPress, Webflow, and Shopify 
websites. Additionally, he and his team build full stack
applications that use React, Next.js, Swift, PostgreSQL,
MongoDB, and more.

Joe is a husband, a dog dad, and an amateur tenor and runner. 
During his free time, he enjoys working on his home with his 
wife, Erica.
